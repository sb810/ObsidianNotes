[[Felix]] and [[Isaak]] are sick today.
[[Megan]]'s contractions are getting worse.

I made [[hot chocolate]] for myself with only [[water]] today. It seems to have helped! Not as tasty as using [[milk]], but it sure beats having cramps all the time. I'm definitely [[lactose intolerant]]. 

We had [[tortellini rosée]] for supper.
